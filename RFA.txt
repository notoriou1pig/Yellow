The Yellow project have to implement the features described in the following list :
/!\ Some are mandatory, some other might be optional, depending of the project progression.

## Mandatory
- Packets dump (alex)
- Packets modification (jonathan)
- Packet forging (jonathan)
- Packet filtering (yaz)
- pcap Import/Export (maxence)
- (.DEB) Debian 7 64/32 (maxence)

## Level 1
- reverse DNS
- GeoIP (yaz, done)
- Global sniffing (Promiscuous mode)
- (.RPM) RHEL/CentOS/Fedora 22 64/32 (droped ?)
- Arch linux User Repository (droped ?)

## Level 2
- Packet blocking
- Network replay
- Traffic replication

## Optional Level
- TCP stream following
- Scripting

The mandatory category describes all the features required by the subject.
This is oriented to receive and send packets with the pcap compliance.

- Packets dump
  The software will be able to dump all the intercepted packets.

- Packets modification
  The user will be able to modify packets and use them after.
  This feature allows to send modified packet instead of regular packet. Both of them will be sent.

- Packet forging
  The user will be able to create his own packets, and to send and recieve them.

- Packet filtering
  This feature allows the user to filter packets by source and destination IP, by Protocol
  or by source and destination port.

- pcap Import/Export
  The software will be able to read and generate pcap dump.

- (.DEB) Debian 7 64/32
  The software will be delivered as a proper debian package (32 and 64 bits).

The Level 1 condenses some features about the packets origin

- reverse DNS
  This feature allows to resolve the domain name from the IP address.

- GeoIP
  This feature gives information on the geolocalisation of the IP.
  It will give the source country of the packets.

- Global sniffing
  The software will be able to get every packets on the network even the one
  which are not destinated to this specific host. It will be possible to launch
  the software as root to enable the promiscuous mode. This mode will allow the
  software to capture packets that are not intended for the host IP address.

- (.RPM) RHEL/CentOS/Fedora 22 64/32
  The software will be delivered as a proper rmp package (32 and 64 bits).  

- Archlinux User Repository
  The software will be delivered on the AUR repository (32 and 64 bits).  

The Level 2 is more focused on features regarding the network traffic.

- Packet blocking
  This feature is related to the Packet modification and the Global sniffing.
  It allows to block the network directly on the device and
  choose what to send and recieve.

- Network replay
  The network replay allows to get some data from the network and
  send it again via a loop.

- Traffic replication
  The traffic replication is another way to build a gateway.
  It allow to get a traffic and send exactly the same to another host.

The Last Level is ambitious and could be delivered depending on the project progression.
- Scripting
  This feature allow to script some packet modification.
  The script will be executed on each packet.
  /!\ The scripting is made for paranoid users.

- TCP stream following
  TCP stream uses a specific exchange of SYN, SYN/ACK, ACK and also
  the sequence number. If we have time we would like to implement a feature
  that allows to follow a complete TCP stream from end to end.
  It simplifies the network debugging for system or network administrators.
